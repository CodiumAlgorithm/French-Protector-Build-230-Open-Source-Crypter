## Note

Don't be a script kiddie, I made this in Old years so you can make your own modifications. This tool is intended as a demo for how easy it is to write your own crypter. It works for its intended purpose and I will not patch it to make it suitable for yours. 


## Features
Xencrypt:
* Bypasses AMSI and all modern AVs in use on VirusTotal (as of writing)
* Compresses and encrypts 
* uses Runpe
* Randomizes variable names to further obfuscate the decrypter stub
* Randomizes encryption, compression and even the order that the statements appear in the code for maximum entropy!
* Super easy to modify to create your own crypter variant
* Binder
* All features in a single file so you can take it with you anywhere!
* Is despite all of the above not a silver bullet for every configuration -- caveat emptor!

## Usage
